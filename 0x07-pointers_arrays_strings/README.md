Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
Returns a pointer to the memory area s

# solution
Here's a pseudocode version of the code:

```
function _memset(s, b, n):
    while n > 0:
        s[n - 1] = b
        n = n - 1
    return s
```

The `_memset` function takes three arguments: a pointer to the memory block to be filled (`s`), the value to be set (`b`), and the number of bytes to be filled (`n`).

The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the memory block starting from the end of the block. In each iteration of the loop, it sets the current byte to the specified value `b` and decrements the number of bytes remaining to be filled `n`. This loop continues until all `n` bytes have been filled with the specified value.

Finally, the function returns a pointer to the memory block that was filled with the specified value.

## 1-memcpy.c 
## pseudocode version of the code:

```
function _memcpy(dest, src, n):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        dest[i] = src[i]
        i = i + 1
    return dest
```

The `_memcpy` function takes three arguments: a pointer to the destination memory area (`dest`), a pointer to the source memory area (`src`), and the number of bytes to copy (`n`).

The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the source and destination memory areas. In each iteration of the loop, it copies the current byte from the source memory area to the corresponding byte in the destination memory area, and then increments the index `i` to move to the next byte. This loop continues until `n` bytes have been copied.

Finally, the function returns a pointer to the destination memory area.

## 2-strchr.c 
##  here's a pseudocode version of the code:

```
function _memcpy(dest, src, n):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        dest[i] = src[i]
        i = i + 1
    return dest
```

The `_memcpy` function takes three arguments: a pointer to the destination memory area (`dest`), a pointer to the source memory area (`src`), and the number of bytes to copy (`n`).

The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the source and destination memory areas. In each iteration of the loop, it copies the current byte from the source memory area to the corresponding byte in the destination memory area, and then increments the index `i` to move to the next byte. This loop continues until `n` bytes have been copied.

Finally, the function returns a pointer to the destination memory area.

## here's a pseudocode version of the code:  3-strspn.c

```
function _strspn(s, accept):
    bytes = 0
    i = 0
    while s[i] != '\0':
        for j = 0 to length(accept) - 1:
            if accept[j] == s[i]:
                bytes = bytes + 1
                break
            else if j == length(accept) - 1:
                return bytes
        i = i + 1
    return bytes
```

The `_strspn` function takes two arguments: a pointer to the string to search (`s`), and a pointer to the characters to search for (`accept`).

The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the characters in the input string `s`. For each character, it uses a `for` loop to iterate through the characters in the reference string `accept`. If the character in `s` matches a character in `accept`, the count of matching bytes `bytes` is incremented and the `for` loop is broken. If the character in `s` does not match any character in `accept`, the function immediately returns the current count of matching bytes. The `while` loop continues until the end of the input string is reached.

Finally, the function returns the total count of matching bytes.

## here's a pseudocode version of the code:  4-strpbrk.c

```
function _strpbrk(s, accept):
    i = 0
    while s[i] != '\0':
        for j = 0 to length(accept) - 1:
            if accept[j] == s[i]:
                return s + i
        i = i + 1
    return NULL
```

The `_strpbrk` function takes two arguments: a pointer to the string to search (`s`), and a pointer to the bytes to search for (`accept`).

The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the characters in the input string `s`. For each character, it uses a `for` loop to iterate through the characters in the reference string `accept`. If the character in `s` matches a character in `accept`, the function returns a pointer to the matching byte in `s`. If the character in `s` does not match any character in `accept`, the function continues to the next character in `s`. The `while` loop continues until the end of the input string is reached.

Finally, the function returns `NULL` if no matching byte is found.


## here's a pseudocode version of the code:5-strstr.c

```
function _strstr(haystack, needle):
    i = 0
    if needle[0] == '\0':
        return haystack
    while haystack[i] != '\0':
        if haystack[i] == needle[0]:
            j = 0
            while needle[j] != '\0' and haystack[i+j] == needle[j]:
                j = j + 1
                if needle[j] == '\0':
                    return haystack + i
        i = i + 1
    return NULL
```

The `_strstr` function takes two arguments: a pointer to the string to search (`haystack`), and a pointer to the substring to search for (`needle`).

The function first checks if the `needle` string is empty. If it is, the function returns a pointer to the `haystack` string.

The function then uses a `while` loop to iterate through the characters in the input string `haystack`. For each character, it checks if the character matches the first character in the reference substring `needle`. If there is a match, the function uses a nested `while` loop to compare the characters in both strings starting from the current position. If all the characters in the `needle` string match the corresponding characters in the `haystack` string, the function returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring in `haystack`. If there is no match, the function continues to the next character in `haystack`. The `while` loop continues until the end of the input string is reached.

Finally, the function returns `NULL` if the substring is not found.


 ## here's a pseudocode version of the  7-print_chessboard.c  

 Sure, here's a pseudocode version of the `print_chessboard` function:

1. Start a loop that iterates from i = 0 to the last row of the chessboard (where a[i][7] is not null).
2. Within the loop, start another loop that iterates from j = 0 to 7 (the number of columns in a row).
3. Within the inner loop, print the character at row i, column j of the chessboard using the _putchar function.
4. After the inner loop has completed, print a newline character to move to the next line.
5. Repeat the process until all rows of the chessboard have been printed.

And here's what the pseudocode would look like in code form:

```
function print_chessboard(a)
    for i = 0 to length(a)-1 do
        for j = 0 to 7 do
            _putchar(a[i][j])
        end for
        _putchar('\n')
    end for
end function
``` 

Note that the `_putchar` function is assumed to be a built-in function that prints a single character to the console.



## Here's an explanation of the pseudocode: 8-print_diagsums.c

```
function print_diagsums(a, size):
    sum1 = 0
    sum2 = 0
    for i in range(size):
        sum1 += a[i]
        a += size
    a -= size
    for i in range(size):
        sum2 += a[i]
        a -= size
    print sum1, sum2
```

The `print_diagsums` function takes two arguments: a pointer to an integer array called `a`, and an integer called `size`. The function calculates the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

The function starts by initializing two variables called `sum1` and `sum2` to zero. The first loop iterates over the elements of the first diagonal of the matrix. It does this by adding the value of each element to `sum1`, and then incrementing the pointer `a` by `size`. This moves the pointer to the next element in the diagonal. After the loop finishes, the pointer is moved back to the beginning of the first diagonal by subtracting `size` from it.

The second loop iterates over the elements of the second diagonal of the matrix. It does this by adding the value of each element to `sum2`, and then decrementing the pointer `a` by `size`. This moves the pointer to the next element in the diagonal. After the loop finishes, the function prints out the values of `sum1` and `sum2`.


## Hereâ€™s the pseudocode for the set_string function:
```
function set_string(s, to):
    s = to
```
The set_string function takes two arguments: a pointer to a pointer to a character called s, and a pointer to a character called to. The function sets the value of the pointer s to the value of the pointer to.

The function starts by assigning the value of to to s. This sets the value of the pointer that s points to (i.e., the original pointer passed into the function) to the value of to.
